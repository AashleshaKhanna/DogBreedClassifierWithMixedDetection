# DogBreedClassifierWithUnknownDetection
This project goes beyond basic CNN image classification by addressing: - Real-world robustness challenges (blur, occlusion, lighting variations) - Open-set recognition (detecting out-of-distribution inputs) - Confidence calibration for reliable predictions - Multi-stage pipeline design (detection → classification → calibration)
